The Apache Flink community is excited to announce the release of Flink 1.13.0! More than 200
contributors worked on over 1,000 issues for this new version.

The release brings us a big step forward in one of our major efforts: **Making Stream Processing
Applications as natural and as simple to manage as any other application.** The new *reactive scaling*
mode means that scaling streaming applications in and out now works like in any other application,
by just changing the number of parallel processes.

The release also prominently features a **series of improvements that help users better understand the performance of
applications.** When the streams don't flow as fast as you'd hope, these can help you to understand
why: Load and *backpressure visualization* to identify bottlenecks, *CPU flame graphs* to identify hot
code paths in your application, and *State Access Latencies* to see how the State Backends are keeping
up.

Beyond those features, the Flink community has added a ton of improvements all over the system,
some of which we discuss in this article. We hope you enjoy the new release and features.
Towards the end of the article, we describe changes to be aware of when upgrading
from earlier versions of Apache Flink.

{% toc %}

We encourage you to [download the release](https://flink.apache.org/downloads.html) and share your
feedback with the community through
the [Flink mailing lists](https://flink.apache.org/community.html#mailing-lists)
or [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/summary).

## Notable Features and Improvements

### Reactive Scaling

Reactive Scaling is the latest piece in Flink's initiative to make Stream Processing
Applications as natural and as simple to manage as any other application.

Flink has a dual nature when it comes to resource management and deployments: You can deploy
Flink applications onto resource orchestrators like Kubernetes or Yarn in such a way that Flink actively manages
the resources, and allocates and releases workers as needed. That is especially useful for jobs and
applications that rapidly change their required resources, like batch applications and ad-hoc SQL
queries. The application parallelism rules, the number of workers follows. In the context of Flink
applications, we call this *active scaling*.

For long running streaming applications, it is often a nicer model to just deploy them like any
other long-running application: The application doesn't really need to know that it runs on K8s,
EKS, Yarn, etc. and doesn't try to acquire a specific amount of workers; instead, it just uses the
number of workers that is given to it. The number of workers rules, the application parallelism
adjusts to that. In the context of Flink, we call that *re-active scaling*.

The [Application Deployment Mode]({{ site.DOCS_BASE_URL }}flink-docs-release-1.13/docs/concepts/flink-architecture/#flink-application-execution)
started this effort, making deployments more application-like (by avoiding two separate deployment
steps to (1) start cluster and (2) submit application). The reactive scaling mode completes this,
and you now don't have to use extra tools (scripts or a K8s operator) any more to keep the number
of workers and the application parallelism settings in sync.

You can now put an auto-scaler around Flink applications like around other typical applications — as
long as you are mindful about the cost of rescaling, when configuring the autoscaler: Stateful
streaming applications must move state around when scaling.

To try the reactive-scaling mode, add the `scheduler-mode: reactive` config entry and deploy
an application cluster ([standalone]({{ site.DOCS_BASE_URL }}flink-docs-release-1.13/docs/deployment/resource-providers/standalone/overview/#application-mode) or [Kubernetes]({{ site.DOCS_BASE_URL }}flink-docs-release-1.13/docs/deployment/resource-providers/standalone/kubernetes/#deploy-application-cluster)). Check out [the reactive scaling docs]({{ site.DOCS_BASE_URL }}flink-docs-release-1.13/docs/deployment/elastic_scaling/#reactive-mode) for more details.


## Analyzing Application Performance

Like for any application, analyzing and understanding the performance of a Flink application
is critical. Often event more critical, because Flink applications are typically data-intensive
(process high volumes of data) and are at the same time expected to provide results within
(near-) real-time latencies.

When an application doesn't keep up with the data rate any more, or an application takes more
resources than you'd expect it would, these new tools can help you track down the causes:

### Bottleneck detection, Back Pressure Monitoring

The first question during performance analysis is often: Which operation is the bottleneck?

To help answer that, Flink exposes metrics about the degree to which tasks are *busy* (doing work)
and *back-pressured* (have capacity to do work, but cannot, because their successor operators
are cannot accept more results). Candidates for bottlenecks are the busy operators whose predecessors
are back-pressured.

Flink 1.13 brings an improved back pressure metric system (using task mailbox timings, rather than
thread stack sampling) and a reworked graphical representation of the job's dataflow with color coding
and ratios for busyness and back pressure.

<figure style="align-content: center">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/blog/2021-04-xx-release-1.13.0/bottleneck.png" style="width: 900px"/>
</figure>

### CPU flame graphs in Web UI

The next question during performance analysis is typically: What part of work in the bottleneck
operator is expensive?

One visually effective means to investigate that are *Flame Graphs*. They help answer question like:
  - Which methods are currently consuming CPU resources?
  - How does one method's CPU consumption compare to other methods?
  - Which series of calls on the stack led to executing a particular method?
  
Flame Graphs are constructed by repeatedly sampling the thread stack traces. Every method call is
represented by a bar, where the length of the bar is proportional to the number of times it is present
in the samples. When enabled, the graphs are shown in a new UI component for the selected operator.

<figure style="align-content: center">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/blog/2021-04-xx-release-1.13.0/7.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 600px"/>
</figure>

Flame graphs are expensive to create: They may cause processing overhead and can put a heavy load
on Flink's metric system. Because of that, users need to explicitly enabled them in the configuration.

### Access Latency Metrics for State

Another possibly performance bottleneck can be the state backend, especially when your state is larger
than the main memory available to Flink and you are using the [RocksDB state backend](
{{ site.DOCS_BASE_URL }}flink-docs-release-1.13/docs/ops/state/state_backends/#the-embeddedrocksdbstatebackend).

That's not saying RocksDB is slow (we love RocksDB!), but it has some requirements to achieve
good performance. For example, it is easy to accidentally [starve RocksDB's demand for IOPs on cloud setups with
the wrong type of disk resources](https://www.ververica.com/blog/the-impact-of-disks-on-rocksdb-state-backend-in-flink-a-case-study).

On top of the CPU flame graphs, the new *state backend latency metrics* can help you understand whether
your state backend is responsive. For example, if you see that RocksDB state accesses start to take
milliseconds, you probably need to look into your memory and I/O configuration.
These metrics can be activated by setting the `state.backend.rocksdb.latency-track-enabled` option.
The metrics are sampled and their collection should have a marginal impact on the RocksDB state
backend performance.

### Switching State Backend with savepoints

You can now change the state backend of a Flink application when resuming from a savepoint.
That means the application's state is no longer locked into the state backend that was used when
the application was initially started.

This makes it possible, for example, to initially start with the HashMap State Backend (pure
in-memory in JVM Heap) and later switch to the RocksDB State Backend, once the state grows
too large.

Under the hood, Flink now has a canonical savepoint format, which all state backends use when
creating a data snapshot for a savepoint.

### User-specified pod templates for Kubernetes Deployments

The [native Kubernetes deployment]({{ site.DOCS_BASE_URL }}flink-docs-release-1.13/docs/deployment/resource-providers/native_kubernetes/)
(where Flink actively talks to K8s to start and stop pods) now supports *custom pod templates*.

With those templates, users can setup and configure the JobManagers and TaskManagers pods in a
Kubernetes-y way, with flexibility beyond the configuration options that are directly built into
Flink's Kubernetes integration.

### Unaligned Checkpoints - Production Ready

Unaligned Checkpoints have matured to the point where we encourage all users to try them out,
if they see issues with their application under backpressure.

In particular, these changes make Unaligned Checkpoints more easily usable:

 - You can now rescale applications from an unaligned checkpoints. This comes in handy, if your
   application needs to be scaled from a retained checkpoint, because you cannot (afford to) create
   a savepoint.

 - Enabling unaligned checkpoints is cheaper for applications that are not back-pressured.
   Unaligned checkpoints can now trigger adaptively with a timeout, meaning a checkpoint starts
   as an aligned checkpoint (not storing any in-flight events) and falls back to an unaliged
   checkpoint (storing some in-flight events), if the alignment phase takes longer than a certain
   time.

Find out more about how to enable unaligned checkpoints in the [Checkpointing Documentation]({{ site.DOCS_BASE_URL }}flink-docs-release-1.13/docs/ops/state/checkpoints/#unaligned-checkpoints).

### Machine Learning Library moving to a separate Repository

To accelerate the development of Flink's Machine Learning efforts (streaming, batch, and
unified machine learning), the effort has moved to the new repository [flink-ml](https://github.com/apache/flink-ml)
under the Flink project. We here follow a similar approach like the *Stateful Functions* effort,
where a separate repository has helped to speed up the development by allowing for more light-weight
contribution workflows and separate release cycles.

Stay tuned for more updates in the Machine Learning efforts, like the interplay of with
[ALink](https://github.com/alibaba/Alink) (suite of many common Machine Learning Algorithms on Flink)
or the [Flink & TensorFlow integration](https://github.com/alibaba/flink-ai-extended).

## Table API/SQL

### Table-valued functions for Windows

Defining time windows is one of the most frequent operations in streaming SQL queries. We updated
the Flink SQL window syntax and semantics to be
closer to the SQL standard. This is in sync with other vendors in the industry by expressing windows
as a kind of table-valued functions.

TUMBLE and HOP windows have been ported to the new syntax. SESSION windows will follow in a
subsequent release. A new CUMULATE window function can assigns windows with an expanding step size
until the maximum window size is reached:

```sql
SELECT window_time, window_start, window_end, SUM(price) AS total_price 
  FROM TABLE(CUMULATE(TABLE Bid, DESCRIPTOR(bidtime), INTERVAL '2' MINUTES, INTERVAL '10' MINUTES))
GROUP BY window_start, window_end, window_time;
```

By referencing window start and window end of the table-valued window functions, it is now possible
to compute Top N windowed aggregations next to regular windowed aggregations and windowed joins:

```sql
SELECT window_time, ...
  FROM (
    SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY window_start, window_end ORDER BY total_price DESC) 
      as rank 
    FROM t
  ) WHERE rank <= 100;
```

### Improved interoperability between DataStream and Table API/SQL 

The Table API becomes equally important to the DataStream API which is why a good interoperability
between the two APIs is crucial. (FLIP-136): The core Row class has received a major update with new
toString/hash/equals methods. Fields can not only be accessed by position but also by name with
support of sparse representations. The new methods `StreamTableEnvironment.toDataStream/fromDataStream`
can model the DataStream API as a regular table source or sink with a smooth type system and event-time
integration.

```java
Table table=tableEnv.fromDataStream(
	dataStream,Schema.newBuilder()
	.columnByMetadata("rowtime","TIMESTAMP(3)")
	.watermark("rowtime","SOURCE_WATERMARK()")
	.build());

DataStream<Row> dataStream=tableEnv.toDataStream(table)
	.keyBy(r->r.getField("user"))
	.window(...)
```

### Improved SQL Client 

During the past releases, the SQL Client's feature set could not keep up with the evolution of the
TableEnvironment in the Table API. In this release, the SQL Client has been updated for feature
parity with the programmatic APIs.

*Easier Configuration and Code Sharing*

The support of YAML files to configure the SQL Client will be discontinued. Instead, the client
accepts one or more initialization scripts to configure an empty session. Additionally, a user can
declare a main SQL script for executing multiple statements in one file.

```
./sql-client.sh -i init1.sql init2.sql -f sqljob.sql
```

*More Commands and Support for Statement Sets*

For multi-statement execution, commands such as STATEMENT SET, and improved SET/RESET
commands with new config options have been added. The following example shows how a full SQL script
could be used as a command line tool to submit Flink jobs in a unified way for both batch and
streaming use cases:

```sql
-- set up a catalog
CREATE CATALOG hive_catalog WITH ('type' = 'hive');
USE CATALOG hive_catalog;

-- or use temporary objects
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE clicks (
  user_id BIGINT,
  page_id BIGINT,
  viewtime TIMESTAMP
) WITH (
  'connector' = 'kafka',
  'topic' = 'clicks',
  'properties.bootstrap.servers' = '...',
  'format' = 'avro'
);

-- set the execution mode for jobs
SET execution.runtime-mode=streaming;

-- set the sync/async mode for INSERT INTOs
SET table.dml-sync=false;

-- set the job's parallelism
SET parallism.default=10;

-- set the job name
SET pipeline.name = my_flink_job;

-- restore state from the specific savepoint path
SET execution.savepoint.path=/tmp/flink-savepoints/savepoint-bb0dab;

BEGIN STATEMENT SET;

INSERT INTO pageview_pv_sink
SELECT page_id, count(1) FROM clicks GROUP BY page_id;

INSERT INTO pageview_uv_sink
SELECT page_id, count(distinct user_id) FROM clicks GROUP BY page_id;

END;
```

### Hive Query syntax compatibility

In order to improve Hive syntax compatibility, we introduced pluggable `Parser` to the planner
and added `HiveParser` for Hive dialect. In addition to DDL, Hive dialect now also supports
commonly-used Hive DML and DQL.

To use Hive dialect, set `table.sql-dialect` to `hive` as you do now, and also make sure to use
`HiveModule` since some syntax/semantic compatibility features rely on Hive built-in functions.
Following is an example of using Hive dialect:

```sql
CREATE CATALOG myhive WITH ('type' = 'hive'); -- setup HiveCatalog
USE CATALOG myhive;
LOAD MODULE hive; -- setup HiveModule
USE MODULES hive,core;
SET table.sql-dialect = hive; -- enable Hive dialect
SELECT key, value FROM src CLUSTER BY key; -- run some Hive queries
```
Note that Hive dialect no longer supports Flink syntax for DML and DQL. Switch to `default` dialect
when you need to write Flink syntax.

### Improved consistency of behavior between different SQL time functions**

Working with time is a crucial element of any data processing. Handling different time zones, dates and times
is one of the hardest tasks in working with data. In Flink 1.13. we put a lot of effort in simplifying the usage
of time related functions to make it a bit easier. We changed or made more specific return types of couple functions such as:
`PROCTIME()`, `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, `NOW()`.

Moreover, since Flink 1.13, you can also define event time attribute on TIMESTAMP_LTZ column. It means you can
gracefully do window processing with the support of the Daylight Saving Time.

Please see the release notes for a complete list of changes.

## PyFlink

### State access in DataStream API 
Stateful stream processing has always been a major differentiator for Apache Flink from other data
processing systems. While many operations in a
dataflow simply look at one individual event at a time (for example an event parser), some
operations remember information across multiple events (for example window operators). These
operations are called stateful.

The 1.12.0 release was the release when we reintroduced a rearchitected Python DataStream API, but
it is the access to State that comes in this release that fully opens up the full potential of
Apache Flink to Python users.

```python
class CountWindowAverage(FlatMapFunction):
    def __init__(self, window_size):
        self.window_size = window_size

    def open(self, runtime_context: RuntimeContext):
        descriptor = ValueStateDescriptor("average", Types.TUPLE([Types.LONG(), Types.LONG()]))
        self.sum = runtime_context.get_state(descriptor)

    def flat_map(self, value):
        current_sum = self.sum.value()
        if current_sum is None:
            current_sum = (0, 0)
        # update the count
        current_sum = (current_sum[0] + 1, current_sum[1] + value[1])
        # if the count reaches window_size, emit the average and clear the state
        if current_sum[0] >= self.window_size:
            self.sum.clear()
            yield value[0], current_sum[1] // current_sum[0]
        else:
            self.sum.update(current_sum)

ds = ...  # type: DataStream
ds.key_by(lambda row: row[0]) \
  .flat_map(CountWindowAverage(5))
```

### Window support in DataStream API

Windows are at the heart of processing infinite streams. Windows split the stream into “buckets” of finite size,
over which we can apply computations. In this release, the support of user-defined window was added in PyFlink
DataStream API.

### Row-based operations in Table API 

Every Flink release brings the Python Table API closer to a full feature parity with the Java API.
In this release, the support for row-based operations was added. Row-based operations take row as
input and returns row as output.

Following is an example of using map operation in Python Table API:
```python
@udf(result_type=DataTypes.ROW(
  [DataTypes.FIELD("c1", DataTypes.BIGINT()),
   DataTypes.FIELD("c2", DataTypes.STRING())]))
def my_map(r: Row) -> Row:
  return Row(r[0] + 1, r[1])

table = ...  # type: Table
mapped_result = table.map(my_map)
```

In addition to map, it also supports flat_map, aggregate, flat_aggregate, etc for row-based operations.

### Batch execution mode for PyFlink DataStream programs

In 1.12, it has added batch execution mode in the Java DataStream API. In this release, this feature
is also added in the Python DataStream API.

## Other improvements

**Flink Documentation via Hugo**

The Flink Documentation has been migrated from Jekyll to Hugo. If you find something missing, please let us know.
We are also curious to hear if you like the new look & feel.

**Exception histories in the Web UI**

The Flink Web UI will present up to *n* last exceptions that caused a job to fail.
That helps to debug scenarios where a root failure caused subsequent failures. The root failure
cause can be found in the exception history.

**Better exception / failure-cause reporting for unsuccessful checkpoints**

Flink now provides statistics for checkpoints that failed or were aborted, to make it easier
to determine the failure cause without having to analyze the logs.

Prior versions of Flink were reporting metrics (e.g., size of persisted data, trigger time)
only in case a checkpoint succeeded.

**Exactly-once JDBC sink**

From 1.13, JDBC sink can guarantee exactly-once delivery of results for XA-compliant databases,
by transactionally committing results on checkpoints. The target database must have (or be linked
to) an XA Transaction Manager.

The connector exists currently only for the *DataStream API*, and can be created through the
`JdbcSink.exactlyOnceSink(...)` method (or by instantiating the `JdbcXaSinkFunction` directly).

**PyFlink Table API supports User-Defined Aggregate Functions in Group Windows**

Group Windows in PyFlink's Table API now support both general Python User-defined Aggrgate
Functions (UDAFs) and Pandas UDAFs. Such functions are critical to many analysis- and ML training
programs.

Flink 1.13 here improves upon previous releases, where these functions were only supported
in unbounded GRoup-By aggregations.

**Improved Sort-Merge Shuffle for Batch Execution**

Flink 1.13 improves the memory stability and performance of the *sort-merge blocking shuffle*
for batch-executed programs, originally introduced in Flink 1.12 via [FLIP-148](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-148%3A+Introduce+Sort-Merge+Based+Blocking+Shuffle+to+Flink). 

Programs with higher parallelism (1000s) should no longer frequently trigger *OutOfMemoryError: Direct Memory*.
The performance (especially on spinning disks) is improved through better I/O scheduling
and broadcast optimizations.

**HBase connector supports async lookup and lookup cache**

The HBase Lookup Table Source now supports an *async lookup mode* and a lookup cache.
This greatly benefits the performance of Table/SQL jobs with lookup joins against HBase, while
reducing the I/O requests to HBase in the common case.

In prior versions, the HBase Lookup Source only communicated synchronously, resulting in lower
pipeline utilization and throughput.

## Change to consider when upgrading to Flink 1.13

* [FLINK-21709](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-21709) - The old planner of the Table &
  SQL API has been deprecated in Flink 1.13 and will be dropped in Flink 1.14.
  The *Blink* engine has been the default planner for some releases now and will be the only one going forward.
  That means that both the `BatchTableEnvironment` and SQL/DataSet interoperability are reaching
  end of life. Please use the unified `TableEnvironment` for batch and stream processing going forward.
* [FLINK-22352](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-22352) The community decided to deprecate
  the Apache Mesos support for Apache Flink. It is subject to removal in the future. Users are
  encouraged to switch to a different resource manager.
* [FLINK-21935](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-21935) - The `state.backend.async`
  option is deprecated. Snapshots are always asynchronous now (as they were by default before) and
  there is no option to configure a synchronous snapshot anymore.
* [FLINK-17012](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-17012) - The tasks' `RUNNING` state was split
  into two states: `INITIALIZING` and `RUNNING`. A task is `INITIALIZING` while it loads the checkpointed state,
  and, in the case of unaligned checkpoints, until the checkpointed in-flight data has been recovered.
  This lets monitoring systems better determine when the tasks are really back to doing work, by making
  the phase for state restoring explicit.
* [FLINK-21698](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-21698) - The *CAST* operation between the
  NUMERIC type and the TIMESTAMP type is problematic and therefore no longer supported: Statements like 
  `CAST(numeric AS TIMESTAMP(3))` will now fail. Please use `TO_TIMESTAMP(FROM_UNIXTIME(numeric))` instead.
* [FLINK-22133](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-22133) The unified source API for connectors
  has a minor breaking change: The `SplitEnumerator.snapshotState()` method was adjusted to accept the
  *Checkpoint ID* of the checkpoint for which the snapshot is created.
